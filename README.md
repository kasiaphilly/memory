# Memory Game

## Description

This website imitates the popular memory game.
It displays a 4x4 deck of cards that can be uncovered by clicking.
The game features a move counter, a timer and star rating.

## How to play
The goal of this game is to match all cards on the deck by pairing the identical icons.
Click on the card to uncover it. Click on another card to see if you can find a match.
If the cards match, they will stay uncovered. If not, both cards will be covered again.
The game ends once you find all the matching pairs.

The game includes a move counter, timer and a star-rating system that will reflect on your performance!
